# Chapter 1 Notes: Building Abstractions with Procedures

**Computational processes** are abstract beings that inhabit computers

Processes evolve to manipulate other abstract things called **data**

The evolution of a process is directed by rules called a **program**

People build programs to direct processes, conjuring the spirits of a computer with their spells

Master engineers can visualize the behavior of their system in advance, organizing the program in a way that can be easily debugged and prevents large-scale risk

Well-designed systems are designed in a **modular manner**, so that the parts can be built, replaced, and debugged separately
